This is known as Vigen√®re's Cipher
Where given a table,
Use the gird alinement from message[i] and key[i], to obtain the decrpyt[i] 

The Solve:
Use Message[i] and added by Key[i] % 26 to encypt the text 
(Where mess and key of [i] is in alpha to number, e.g a=0, b=1, c=2 ... z=25)

Thus to decrpyt the text, is by
encrypt[i] + key[i] % 26 = message[i]

I have written a script in python to solve the following and print the answer
